#### Creating or Deleting a New Sales Record:
**URL**
http://localhost:8090/api/salesrecords/:id/
To create a new sales record, you need a price, salesperson's name, customer's ID,
and automobile href. The href is to correctly identify the automobile across microservices
since the automobile VIN is a VO objected imported by the poller from another microservice.
You can verify that the poller is working through creating a new entry here, or the form on
the React front-end.
An id is automatically assigned and cannot be altered.

To delete a sales record, put the URL into Insomnia using a 'DELETE' method, and no information
is required.

    {
        "price": "14000",
        "salesperson": "George",
        "customer": 7,
        "automobile": "/api/automobiles/1C3CC5FB2AN120177/"
    }

## Design

![ProjectBetaDiagram](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52739099331_fc6f929802_k.jpg)

#### Service Value Objects
    Imported the VIN from the Automobile model in the Inventory microservice to associate a service appointment with a vehicle that was sold from the dealership so the conceierge can give the owner VIP treatment.
    The poller also imported the href of the instance of the automobile object it was creating or updating so specific automobiles could be identified accurately across the microservices.

#### Sales Value Objects:
    Imported the VIN from the Automobile model in the Inventory microservice so a sales record could be created once a vehicle from the dealership was sold.
    The poller also imported the href of the instance of the automobile object it was creating or updating so specific automobiles could be identified accurately across the microservices.

<br>

#####
## Sales microservice

The Sales microservice has three models: SalesPerson, Customer, and SalesRecord. The Customer model has name, address, and phone number fields to record the contact information for existing or potential customers. This feature allows sales representatives to follow up with prospective leads or to log existing customers for further promotions. The SalesPerson model has name and employee number fields to record information about new or existing sales employees, which allows managers to track sales records.

The SalesRecord model has foreign keys for the SalesPerson model, the Customer Model, and the AutomobileVO object. When a sales record is created, it is automatically associated with a salesperson, customer, and a specific automobile. The SalesRecord model also includes a price field to record the sale price.

Additionally, each model has REST endpoints to create, read, update, and delete data.

A poller imports the VIN numbers from the inventory microservice to ensure the sales microservice is always up-to-date with inventory.

The Sales microservice also provides an intuitive user interface for adding salespersons, customers, and sales records. The sales record feature does not allow users to record that they have sold a car twice. It is implemented with a drop-down menu showing only the VIN numbers of cars that have not yet been sold.

The Sales microservice is an important component of a larger system for managing an automobile dealership. By integrating with the inventory microservice and providing a user-friendly interface for tracking sales, the sales microservice helps ensure that the sales process is efficient and accurate.
